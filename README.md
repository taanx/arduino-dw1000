# arduino-dw1000
A library that offers basic functionality to use Decawave's DW1000 chips/modules with Arduino (see https://www.decawave.com/products/dwm1000-module).

This is my internship project from when I was still studying at Rajamangala University of Technology Lanna Nan. I had the opportunity to intern at ECU SHOP 1 in Chiang Mai in the R&D position. ECU SHOP is a company that produces ECU boxes, both software and hardware.

This project has been tested for accuracy, but it is still 100% complete. I would like to thank ECU SHOP for giving me the opportunity to intern.
